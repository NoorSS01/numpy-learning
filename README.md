# NumPy Learning Notebooks

A comprehensive learning repository covering NumPy fundamentals to advanced operations with real-world business examples.

## 📚 Project Structure

This repository contains 4 progressive phases of NumPy learning:

### Phase-1: NumPy Array and Basics
- Creating arrays from Python lists (1D and 2D)
- Understanding Python lists vs NumPy arrays
- Performance comparison between lists and arrays
- Creating arrays from scratch using `zeros()`, `ones()`, and `full()`

### Phase-2: NumPy Array Operations
- Array slicing and indexing techniques
- 1D and 2D array slicing with steps
- Negative indexing
- Accessing specific elements, rows, and columns
- Sorting arrays and 2D arrays

### Phase-3: Advanced Operations with Business Example
- Real-world Zomato sales data analysis
- Aggregations using `sum()` and `min()`
- Computing statistics across different axes
- Grouping and analyzing multi-year sales data

### Phase-4: File I/O and Visualization
- Saving arrays to `.npy` files using `np.save()`
- Loading arrays from files using `np.load()`
- Image manipulation and visualization with `matplotlib`
- Working with pre-trained numpy arrays (NumPy logo)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for Phase-3 and Phase-4)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd numpy-learning
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

3. Open the notebooks with Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 📝 How to Use

1. Start with **Phase-1.ipynb** to understand NumPy basics
2. Progress to **Phase-2.ipynb** for array operations
